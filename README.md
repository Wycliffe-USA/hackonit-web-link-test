##### Web walk on Wycliffe USA

_Problem sponsored by the Software Development Team, Information Technology_

_Facilitated by Brent Dehamer_

### About 

Wycliffe USAâ€™s Software Development Team equips and serves Bible translation partners by building timely innovative software solutions and integrated systems. Software development includes ongoing enhancement of the Wycliffe.org website.

### Objective 

With the constant iterative and incremental change happening on the Wycliffe.org website, maintaining a positive user experience is important and difficult. When links break or buttons do not work; the user experience is not acceptable. 

An automated testing effort has started, but the tests are currently programmed and changed on a case by case basis. This effort takes a lot of resource. To accelerate software development, we plan to create a program that can inventory website elements like hrefs, buttons, etc. and reflect those changes in the website tests.
